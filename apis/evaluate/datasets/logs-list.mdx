title: "List logs"
api: "GET https://api.respan.ai/api/datasets/{dataset_id}/logs/list/"
---

This endpoint retrieves the logs that have been added to a dataset. It supports pagination, filtering, and ordering.

## Authentication

- API key: `Authorization: Bearer <API key>`

Query Parameters:

- page (integer, optional): Page number for pagination (default: 1)
- page_size (integer, optional): Number of results per page (default: varies based on pagination settings)
- sort_by (string, optional): Field to order results by (default: unique_id). Use a leading minus for descending (e.g. `-timestamp`).
- retrieval_mode (string, optional): Set to `"async"` for background full-object loading when listing many logs.

Request example:

```bash
GET /api/datasets/{dataset_id}/logs/list/?page=1&page_size=10&sort_by=-timestamp
```

Response (200 OK):

<Note>
The same URL supports **POST** with a JSON body for complex filtering (e.g. `filters`, `page`, `page_size`). See [List logs with filters](/apis/evaluate/datasets/logs-list-post) for the POST contract.
</Note>

Response Fields:

- count (integer): Total number of logs in the dataset matching the filters
- next (string|null): URL for the next page of results
- previous (string|null): URL for the previous page of results
- results (array): Array of log objects with their details
- filters_data (object): Available filter options for the dataset logs (for building filter UIs)
- Each log includes:
  - Basic log metadata (id, timestamp, tokens, cost, latency, etc.)
  - Model information
  - Prompt and completion text (if available)
  - dataset_id: The dataset this log belongs to
  - annotation_status: Status of human annotation (pending, completed, etc.)
  - annotation_completed_by: User who completed the annotation
  - scores: Array of evaluation scores for this log

Errors:

- 401 Unauthorized — Missing/invalid authentication
- 404 Not Found — Dataset not found or not in your organization

Notes:

- Logs are returned with enriched data including annotation status and evaluation scores
- The endpoint supports the same filter structure as other log listing endpoints
- Results are paginated automatically

Logging images with Respan follows the same process as regular logging, but includes image URLs in the message content.

## Image Format

Include images in your prompt messages using this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "type": "image_url",
  "image_url": {
    "url": "https://keywordsai-static.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Integrations/integration_cards/openai_agent_v0.png",
    "detail": "auto"
  }
}
```

## Example Request

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4-vision-preview",
  "prompt_messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What do you see in this image?"
        },
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {
            "url": "https://keywordsai-static.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Integrations/integration_cards/openai_agent_v0.png",
            "detail": "auto"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "completion_message": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "This image is the logo for OpenAI Agent, featuring a circular design with a stylized 'O' shape."
  },
  "prompt_tokens": 1120,
  "completion_tokens": 23
}
```

## Key Points

- Use vision-capable models for evaluations.
- Images are included as `image_url` objects within the message content array
- The `detail` parameter can be set to `auto`, `low`, or `high`
- All other logging parameters remain the same as regular text logging

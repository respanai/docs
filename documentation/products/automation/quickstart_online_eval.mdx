## What is an online evals automation? 
Online evals automatically runs evaluators on your production logs in real-time based on conditions and sampling rules.

## How to set up an online evals automation?

### 1. Create a condition

A **condition** defines the filtering rules that determine which production logs will be evaluated—only logs that match the condition proceed to the sampling and evals stages.  
Go to [Conditions](https://platform.respan.ai/platform/api/conditions).

</Frame>

You can choose one of the following **condition types**:
- **Single log** – triggers when a specific log matches the rule.
- **Aggregation** – triggers based on aggregated metrics over time.

We will choose **Single log** for **Online evals**.  
Following is a simple condition that triggers everytime a log with status code 500 is logged.

### 2. Create an automation

Once your condition and [evaluator](https://respan.ai/docs/documentation/products/evaluation/llm-evals/llm-evaluator) are ready, navigate to [Automations](https://platform.respan.ai/platform/monitors) and create a new **automation**.

</Frame>

In the creation form:
1. Select **Online evals** as the type.
2. Select the **condition** you want to track.  
3. Choose the **evaluator** you want to run through.  
4. Set the **Sampling rate** (range from 0 to 1).

After saving, your online evals will appear in the [Automations](https://platform.respan.ai/platform/monitors) list.  
When the defined condition is met, sampling will be done and run through evaluators.

### 3. Check online evals results

After condition is triggered, online evals results will be shown in the table of the automation detail page.

#### Table columns

The results table displays the following information for each evaluation:

- **Time** – When the evaluation was executed
- **ID** – Unique identifier for the evaluation score
- **Environment** – The environment where the log was generated (e.g., `test`, `production`)
- **Evaluator** – Name of the evaluator that was run
- **Log ID** – The ID of the log that was evaluated

Click on any row to open the detailed sidepanel.

#### Sidepanel details

The sidepanel on the right provides comprehensive information about the selected evaluation result:
